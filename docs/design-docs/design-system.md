## Design Concept

**Ember & Smoke** is a luxurious, cinematic design system inspired by the rich atmosphere of artisan coffee houses. It evokes the sensory experience of premium coffee — the deep darkness of espresso, the warmth of burnished copper pour-overs, and the ethereal rise of steam.

> *"A design that feels like the first sip of a perfectly extracted espresso — rich, warm, and unforgettable."*

## Color Philosophy

### The Palette

| Token | Color | Inspiration |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **Background** | `hsl(20 35% 4%)` | Espresso bean darkness |
| **Foreground** | `hsl(38 45% 88%)` | Latte foam warmth |
| **Primary** | `hsl(25 85% 58%)` | Burnished copper |
| **Secondary** | `hsl(15 20% 14%)` | Charred oak |
| **Accent** | `hsl(350 45% 35%)` | Aged leather / Burgundy |
| **Muted** | `hsl(18 18% 12%)` | Ash and ember |

### Color Rationale

- **Deep espresso backgrounds** create cinematic depth and focus
- **Warm cream foreground** provides comfortable reading without harsh white
- **Burnished copper** accents feel premium and tactile, like well-aged barista equipment
- **Burgundy accents** add richness, inspired by wine notes in specialty coffee
